# Welcome to Project27 Research

We collaborate with research groups to co-design appropriate academic and innovation projects, which aim to make the lives of disabled people easier, and more enjoyable.

We also do our own research on topics and tools specific to [Project27 Skills.](https://project27skills.com)

## Notice!

This research site of Project27 is under development.
Please be forgiving until we create a better user experience.
We can't wait to showcase all the awesome research we are involved in, in their full glory.
