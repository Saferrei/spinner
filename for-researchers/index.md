We partner with researchers to co-design solutions to the real problems.

## What Is Co-Design And What Do We offer?

Co-design is the approach of actively involving stakeholders in the design process. This is essential for the work that we do as it grants researchers the information to understand the problems blind or learning disabled people experience, and with our consultancy, invent ways in which we can overcome those barriers. By making sure that a blind or learning disabled person is in the team of every project in research and innovation before an accessibility challenge is addressed, it will be certified that disability inclusion is considered and implemented to accommodate to everyone’s needs.

## Why Use Co-Design?
Co-designing solutions not only lets you make sure that everyone’s needs are accounted for, but it also makes sure that work environments are inclusive and welcoming, granting anyone the chance to thrive. Co-design uses the latest research to scale solutions that work from the beginning of the developments of your project, instead of finding these barriers at the end through a user study. For example, if you are a researcher collaborating with multiple people to complete a research project, our services would advise you ways in which to make your project more accessible to everyone participating. This allows your research to be less time consuming and more efficient as the scale solutions create accurate results for ways to be more accessible, enabling disabled researchers and readers to interact with the project being made.
