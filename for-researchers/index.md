We partner with researchers to co-design solutions to real problems.

<br/>

## What Is Co-Design And What Do We offer?

Co-design is the approach of actively involving stakeholders in the design process. This is essential for the work that we do as it grants researchers the information to understand the problems blind or learning disabled people experience, and with our consultancy, invent ways in which we can overcome those barriers. By making sure that a blind or learning disabled person is in the team of every project in research and innovation before an accessibility challenge is addressed, it will be certified that disability inclusion is considered and implemented to accommodate to everyone’s needs. 

<br/>

## Why Use Co-Design?
Co-designing solutions not only lets you make sure that everyone’s needs are accounted for, but it also makes sure that work environments are inclusive and welcoming, granting anyone the chance to thrive. Co-design uses the latest research to scale solutions that work from the beginning of the developments of your project, instead of finding these barriers at the end through a user study. For example, if you are a researcher collaborating with multiple people to complete a research project, our services would advise you ways in which to make your project more accessible to everyone participating. This allows your research to be less time consuming and more efficient as the scale solutions create accurate results for ways to be more accessible, enabling disabled researchers and readers to interact with the project being made.

## Example Of The Utility Of Co-Design:
Dr Daniel Hajas, a screen reader user with a PhD in HCL and accessible communication and the co-founder of PCG worked with the MIT Visualization Group in their project Ollie, which is an open-source library for converting data visualizations into accessible text structures for screen reader users.  Using Haja’s experiences of living with a disability, academic experience of research procedures, and an interest in the science of visualisation, along with additional participants, different perspectives could be used to make Olli accessible to a wider audience. Over six months all authors would meet weekly for hour long video conferences yielding 15 prototypes. Through co-design, all participants could collaborate and give fast feedback allowing developers to make small changes on the prototypes regularly. Following these weekly meetings, Hajas wrote memos specifying the motivations for each prototype, expanding on its most successful features, summarizing the interactions and feedback given in the meetings, and further questions still left to explore in future prototypes. Co-designing ensured that the authors would get real time feedback, making it more efficient to constantly make small changes rather than make major changes at the end of the early development process.
