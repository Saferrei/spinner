## {{ page.title }}

The mission statement is how {{ site.brand }} will make its vision come true.
If the vision is the destination, the mission is the path to our goal.

{{ site.brand }} helps blind or learning disabled people to develop skills that matter, by reducing frustrations of inaccessible learning tools and building confidence in their abilities, through peer support, personalised opportunities for learning, creating, and discovering new challenges in a safe place built by its community.

By learning, we are able to create. Through creations, we are able to discover new challenges. New challenges allow us to learn more, and begin teaching those who know less than us. 

We believe that by setting challenges at the right level, and allowing people to develop skills that matter to them, people will enjoy the process more. We want community members to experience flow, and enjoy what they learn and create. This is more likely to happen in a safe, supportive environment.

Enjoying the flow experience of skills development is likely to increase confidence in our abilities. The outcome of higher self-confidence can be translated into confidence of finding employment, performing well, and enjoying work. Therefore, developing skills that matter, in a safe space supported by mentors, helps people to live more joyful lives.
