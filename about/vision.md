## {{ page.title }}

This vision statement reflects the belief of where we will be in 2050.

We imagine the {{ site.brand }} {{ site.product }} to be only one of many projects on the {{ site.brand }} platform.
Community members are getting involved with the growth of the {{ site.brand }} {{ site.product }}, developing skills that matter to both of us and them.

The wider platform allows like-minded people to develop skills that matter to them, through the creation and management of new community projects.
Members help others to grow, through peer support and new opportunities for skills development.

The community drives business activities, and the revenue is invested in new research and development projects.
