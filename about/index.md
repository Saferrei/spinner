## About {{ site.brand }}

{{ site.brand }} is the research and innovation arm of {{ site.organisation }} ({{ site.org }}).
We combine for-profit practices with nonprofit missions to create positive outcomes in a sustainable way.

The mission of {{ site.org }} is to 
**design solutions that work, and develop skills that matter.**
We believe that this mission will take us closer to our ultimate vision.

In the vision of {{ site.org }}, 
**Researchers, businesses, and the community of blind or learning disabled people work together on solving accessibility challenges at every stage of design and development.**

### What we do

1. **Knowledge exchange**: We help researchers and businesses with knowledge exchange, disseminating project learnings, and engaging with other stakeholders, through our blog and network.
2. **Co-designing solutions**: We enable researchers to understand the real problems blind or learning disabled people experience, through an iterative process of co-design and consultancy, such that the right research questions are addressed.
3. **Diffusing innovation**: We work with businesses to identify opportunities for innovation in accessibility, diffuse the latest research and development outputs, and scale solutions that work for blind or learning disabled people.

### Who we are

We are Daniel and Danielle, a couple from Brighton, England.
We have seen many products and services developed for blind or learning disabled people, but only a few solutions were designed with people like us..
We wanted solutions to work, so we set up {{ site.brand }}.
