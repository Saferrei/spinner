Easier than it looks. A light delight, in form of a cake not to be baked.

{% capture kitchenware %}
1. 1 glass dish, approximately 35cm long, 20cm wide, and 5cm deep;
2. 2 mixing bowls;
3. an electric whisk;
{% endcapture %}

{% capture steps %}
1. Mix the Mascarpone with 100 grams of sugar.
2. Use the other 100g of sugar, to whisk the egg yolks [(see Tip 1)](#tip1) into a thick cream. While whisking, add the vanilla sugar. When creamy, add the cinnamon.
3. Pour the two separate mixtures into one bowl, and whisk them together well.
4. Prepare a black coffee into a bowl, and take the dish in which you'll prepare the tiramisu.
5. Submerge the lady fingers (sponge fingers) into the coffee one by one, for 1-2 seconds. Layer the soaked fingers at the bottom of the dish.
6. Once the first layer is complete, spread the half of the Mascarpone cream. Add another layer of soaked lady fingers, and a second layer of cream on top.
7. Cover the dish with cling film, and leave it in the fridge for over night.
8. Serve with a bit of coco powder on top.

{% capture tip1 %}
Use an egg separator. These are handy, little cup-shaped tools with a slit at the bottom.
They let the egg white run through, while keeping the yolk in the cup.
You can buy these in most kitchenware or online shop for a few pounds.
