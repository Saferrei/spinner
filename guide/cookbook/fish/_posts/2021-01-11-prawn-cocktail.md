One of my personal favourites. I've tried many prawn cocktails in various places, but none of them were as delicious as mum's home made version of this starter.

3. take a cleaned lemon and cut it in half. Grate the lemon zest into the mayonnaise directly. Then squeeze the juice of the lemon into a glass, and filter it before use.
4. Add the mustard, 1-2 tbsp of lemon juice, the sugar, the brandy, a pinch of salt, and twist of pepper to the mayonnaise and mix it a little.
5. Now finely chop the red onion. If it is larger, half will be enough. Similarly, chop up finely the pealed red apple. Add these to the mayonnaise.
6. Cover the sauce and leave in the fridge for a hour.
7. Bring water to the boil with a tbsp of lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Add the pealed prawns and cook for 2 minutes. We filter the cooked prawns under ice cold water, so it does not carry on cooking in the heat. Let the prawns drip in the colander. Mix the prawns to the sauce.
8. Serve the cocktail onto a bowl of fresh lettuce, and a slice of toast.
