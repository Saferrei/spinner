A roll for every season, let it be spring or summer. The wife of a Vietnamese colleague makes these amazing spring rolls, so I had to try it myself. Crispy, delicious, and you can easily eat one too many.

### Dipping sauce:

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the fish sauce, sugar, lime, a bit soy sauce for nice colouring, very finely chopped garlic and chilly flakes or nicely chopped chilly if it's fresh. Add warm water to play with the thickness of the sauce.

### The rolls

2. In another mixing bowl, add the pork mince, roughly grated carrots, finely chopped onions, and the finely chopped mushrooms. Add also the bean sprouts.
3. Boil water and cook the glass vermicelli (alternatively rice vermicelli) for 5 minutes. When boiled, cut the vermicelli to small size (about 3cm long).
4. Add 1-2 medium sized eggs then mix. Don’t add too much egg otherwise it becomes watery and burst when frying.
5. Add a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of pepper (I like the heat so sometimes put a tablespoon of pepper)
6. Mix everything up gently with your hands. Leave them about 20 minutes for things to bond together.
7. Start wrapping. One full table spoon for each roll should be enough. Roll one turn, fold the left & right side so it’s all nicely closed, then  keep rolling to the end. If the rice paper is dry, quickly dip each paper in warm water. 

### Frying

So you’ve done the most challenging bit. Now come to the fun: Frying. This step is to make sure the inside is cooked. Pour oil into a pan so the roll submerged half in the oil. Fry in medium heat so you just about to see the oil bubbling around the rolls. 
- Gently flip the rolls to fry the other side when they start to get yellow / light brown.

If you want to save some in freezer, wait for it to cool down. These can be cooked from frozen, Just pan fry to achieve the golden brown finish when you want to eat it.
