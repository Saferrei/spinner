# Vectors

## Scalar product

Given two vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$, and the angle $\theta$ between the two vectors, the scalor product can be calculated as:
$$
\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B} = |A||B| \cos \theta
$$

## Vector product

Given two vectors $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$, and the angle $\theta$ between the two vectors, the vector product can be calculated as:
$$
\vec{A}\times \vec{B} = |A||B| \sin \theta
$$
