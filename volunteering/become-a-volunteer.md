## {{ page.title }}

Thanks for your interest in becoming a volunteer. To do so, we have a few different ways for you to apply.

### Our preferred application process

please download the short application form and e-mail it to us as an attachment. Our e-mail address is support@project27skills.com.

<a class="{{ page.buttonStyle }}" href="{{ '/assets/documents/Project27--Application-form-for-volunteers.md' | prepend: site.baseurl}}" download="Project27 - Application form for volunteers">

</a>

The application process is very quick and simple, but it is also a small, self-contained challenge. By sending us your completed application form, you show us:

* how committed you are to learning,
* how well you can create a screen reader accessible document,
* whether you respect our application process, and
* how engaging your first {{ site.brand }} written piece is.

### Alternative ways of applying

We appreciate our preferred application process may not suit everyone. However, we would like to welcome all volunteers, who feel they can contribute to {{ site.brand }} in line with our values and culture.

For this reason, we welcome alternative formats of applications, in which you answer the following questions: 

1. What's your name?
2. Which task would you like to work on?
3. How much time are you likely to commit to volunteering?
4. What's your motivation for becoming a volunteer?
5. Why did you choose this alternative format of application?

Some of our suggestions for alternative application formats are:

+ a 3 minute video or audio recording;
+ an electronic document, such as Microsoft Word or a text file attached and sent to our e-mail address;
+ responses directly sent in the body of an e-mail to our e-mail address;
+ a posted letter to our PO box (currently not available).;

### After you applied

After we received an application, we will consider it, get back to you, and arrange a call with you to discuss your existing skills, the skills you would like to develop, and the level of your involvement.

Go ahead and remember: "Together we learn, together we grow". We look forward to welcoming you.
