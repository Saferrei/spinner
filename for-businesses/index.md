## What Is Disability Inclusion And Disability Innovation And Why Use It?
Disability inclusion is essential to any business as not doing so would be the potential exclusion of 1.3 billion people worldwide. Disability inclusion is the inclusion and encouragement of people with disabilities to have the same roles non-disabled people have in the work environment through adequate policies and practices. Our services advise businesses to produce scale solutions to create a work environment where inclusive and accessible practices are implemented to create equity in businesses. Disability innovation is the use of research to produce solutions to increase disability inclusion. By adopting disability innovation and co-design in your business, you have the potential to gain business value due to an increase of customer loyalty and profit. As seen in research done by The Purple Pound, businesses lose approximately 2 billion pounds a month by ignoring the needs of disabled people. This statistic exemplifies how the lack of accessibility for disabled people can result in a loss of profit and potential customers. Our services ensure a smooth early adoption of innovation allowing your business to be accessible from the beginning, wasting less time trying to find the barriers and problems preventing your business to be fully accessible and inclusive.

## Opportunity For Disability Innovation:
Opportunity for innovation is the process of looking for openings or areas in your business where disability innovation could be implemented to improve accessibility. Through the diffusion of disability innovation, we can make sure that everyone’s needs are accounted for, which nurtures work environments that are inclusive and welcoming, allowing anyone the chance to thrive.

## Scaling Solutions That Work:
Scaling solutions is a method for allowing the expansion of your business by increasing efficiency by generating different solutions depending on the size of the situation. This is done by granting businesses the information to understand the problems blind or learning disabled people experience, and with our consultancy, develop solutions which can overcome those barriers. By making sure that a blind or learning disabled person is in the team of every project in research and innovation before an accessibility challenge is addressed, it will be certified that disability inclusion is considered and implemented to accommodate to everyone’s needs and that the appropriate solution is given to the specific situation.
