- question: Is Project27 only for blind or learning disabled people?
  answer: No. Our volunteering opportunities and support services are for anyone who wants to contribute, and help the community of blind or learning disabled people. For example, if you are a junior web developer and want to learn about web accessibility, you are welcomed. Likewise, if you are someone looking after a learning disabled person, you can volunteer to get your skills developed through active learning.
- question: Can I add a blog post?
  answer: Yes, if you contribute to Project27 through a volunteering opportunity, and you'd like to log your contribution, we'll work with you to get your post online.
