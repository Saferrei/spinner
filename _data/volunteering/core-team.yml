  role: co-founder
  contribution: As a co-founder of Project27, my main contribution is setting the vision, the roadmap, and the project culture. However, I also love to get involved with hands-on development, such as hosting the project on GitHub, and writing Jekyll code. Of course, I write, edit, and review content for the Guide and the blog too.
