  description: I'm intending to use LaTeX syntax within MarkDown and web scripts to produce the MathML eventually visible on the web pages of Project27. However, I expect this will not always be a gentle ride. Thus, it makes sense to log LaTeX to MathML related issues.

  link: /blog/logbook/MathML-usability/index.html
  description: I'm aware that MathML is a standardised markup language. However, what is not standardised is the way different screen readers handle it. I hope to take notes on anything related to MathML usability. One day this might come handy.

  description: Then there is a general page to track issues. This can be issues with the quality of the creative content, issues with web development, or issues with accessibility. Some of this issue tracking will happen through short posts, and some will happen through more robust methods, such as GitHub's own issue tracking. Yes, I know. Issue is an overused word. Issue-Issue-Issue... Any issues with that?
