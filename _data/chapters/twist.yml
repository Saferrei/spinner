  description: Living with disabilities is an adventure. There are so many things in life that give us the opportunity to think about how different people with different needs approach their adventure. Let it be a bus journey, a long weekend in the woods, or a sailing trip across the Atlantic, I like to speculate on one or another journey of my life.
- name: Identities

  description: I am not just I. I am Me, myself, and I. I believe it is important to understand that we can not stick labels on people. The way I see a person is as a collection of identities. Through these set of scribbles, I'd like to illustrate this point through my own identities. As my good friend once said - "Daniel, you are 50 shades of Daniel".

  description: Once you know yourself, yes, all many of yourselves, it is time to get to know others. Personal relationships are fantastic, but physical connection is not always viable. Luckily, the greatest invention of time - writing - enable you and I to meet, and have a conversation with anyone. Well, anyone who decided to write a book and published it. In the scribbles on reading, I'll attempt to paint a picture of the conversations between book authors and me.

- name: Nanotips and FAQs
  link: /blog/twist/nanotip/index.html
  description: Nanotips and FAQs are a set of scribbles, which are either bite size and do not fit any other category; or posts that are longer, but contain standard answers to frequently asked questions by people, who asked for my advice and tips in the past.
- name: Grapheel archive
  link: /blog/twist/grapheel-archive/index.html
  description: Once upon a time... sorry, I mean - "A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away..." - there was a project called Grapheel. The Grapheel archive does what it says on the tin. Since I authored some of those earlier posts, and I think they are still valuable, I decided to archive them on TWIST. However, no new scribbles will be added here.
