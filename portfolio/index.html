        <h2>Project Olli</h2>
        <p>Olli is an open-source library for converting data visualizations into accessible text structures for screen reader users. 
            Starting with an existing visualization specification created with a supported toolkit, Olli produces a keyboard-navigable 
            tree view with descriptions at varying levels of detail. Users can explore these structures both to get an initial overview, 
            and to dive into the data in more detail.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            We worked with the MIT Visualisation Group using co-design to assist in improving and developing Olli in its early development
             stage using technology diffusion to update Olli with the latest research in disability innovation. To learn more about co-design
              and what we do head to the For Researchers page in our website. To learn more about technology diffusion head to the For 
              Businesses page in our website.</p>
