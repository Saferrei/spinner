        <h2>Project Olli</h2>
        <p>Olli is an open-source library for converting data visualizations into accessible text structures for screen reader users. 
            Starting with an existing visualization specification created with a supported toolkit, Olli produces a keyboard-navigable 
            tree view with descriptions at varying levels of detail. Users can explore these structures both to get an initial overview, 
            and to dive into the data in more detail.</p>
