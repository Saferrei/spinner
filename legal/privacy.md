The {{ site.brand }} team takes privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy, we provide this privacy statement, explaining the way your personal information is collected, stored, and used.

### What is a privacy policy or privacy statement?

A privacy policy is a description of what we do with personal data. A privacy statement describes how websites or apps, and the people operating these collect, use, store, and share or disclose information about people. Providing a privacy policy also helps our visitors understand what happens to information about them.

### Collecting personal information

We collect a very small amount of personal information, such as names and e-mail addresses. We do this through our application form for volunteers. 

### Website analytics: collection of routine information

This website tracks basic information about its visitors. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify specific visitors to this website. 

### Storing personal and analytic information

We may keep a record of names and e-mail addresses of volunteer applicants. When we do, we treat the collected data confidentially, and store data on an encrypted external data storage unit. Only authorised members of the {{ site.brand }} can access the securely stored data.

Analytic information is provided and stored by our third-party website analytics service provider. The collected data is stored on remote servers of the third-party service provider, and access to this data is restricted by a password protected user account, controlled by an authorised member of the {{ site.brand }} team.

### Using your information

The tracked website analytics is collected to enable improvements on the website.

### Sharing or distributing personal information

We do not share or distribute any information collected through the website.

### Links to Third Party Websites

We have included links on this website for your use and reference. We are not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these websites may differ from our own.

### Security

The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Changes To This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is effective as of {{ page.date }} and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. If [["we" or "I"]] make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you either through the email address you have provided us , or by placing a prominent notice on our website.
