## {{ page.title }}

1. Transitioned the volumes of {{ site.product }} into folders of posts, rather than pages.
2. Streamlined the set of layouts used by pages and posts.
3. Began work on implementing a new, and more consistent design within the default layout:
 - Introducing a sidebar,
 - expanding and restructuring the footer.
4. Bug fixes.
