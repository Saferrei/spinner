## {{ page.title }}

1. Updated the post layout
 - excerpts now appear right under the title, and the content follows after the cover image and video content, if any.
2. Made it easier to include YouTube content
 - If a post has an associated video, the site builder will automatically include the embedded YouTube video player, append a short text, display attribution, and separate the video region from the rest of the post.
3. We also broke the mobile view, and images don't display correctly on phones.
