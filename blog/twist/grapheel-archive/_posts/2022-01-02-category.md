The posts in this category have been rolled over and archived from my two previous blogs. My first blog was called "SENSE: Science Education as a Non-Sighted Experience", while the second blog was populated by the Grapheel team.

I started SENSe, when I was a physics undergraduate to talk about some aspects of studying science as a blind student. I also did this blog to get a taste of blogging.

The Grapheel blog was a part of the Grapheel website, which me and a couple other people worked on as student, social entrepreneurs. The website came with Grapheel Limited, a start-up company, which I have co-founded. Grapheel was hoping to make science education more accessible for blind learners.

In this category, I wish to archive those posts which I authored earlier, as part of other blogs, but which never the less still hold value in my opinion. If nothing else, these early posts portray my thoughts and writing style from a few years prior to starting {{ site.brand }}.
